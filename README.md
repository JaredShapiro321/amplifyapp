# Miami University Campus Dining

A prototype web application designed to help the students of Miami University Ohio to find what food is offered where and to help track their meals throughout the week.

## About

This project was created as an honors course extension for CSE 271. My vision was to create a web app that would display information retrieved from Miami's [NetNutrition webpage](https://miaminutrition.miamioh.edu/NetNutrition/MU) in a more visually appealing and easily usable way.

The app is currently hosted using [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and can be found here: [Miami University Campus Dining](https://master.d32pndr8fjbhfe.amplifyapp.com/#/)

## Development
